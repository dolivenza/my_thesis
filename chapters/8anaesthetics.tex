\markboth{Anaesthetics in PTR-MS}{}


This chapter contains PTR-MS results from isoflurane and sevoflurane acquired for reproducibility purposes that contributed to the discussion and publication of the following paper (reference \cite{ISOF_paper}):

\fullcite{ISOF_paper}\footnote{Ms Michaela Malásková and Mr David Olivenza-León are Early Stage Researchers attached to the IMPACT ITN. They contributed equally to the experimental investigations, and hence they should be considered as joint first authors.}.


The experimental data published in this paper is that acquired by the first author, including PTR-MS investigations of desflurane and enflurane.
%
Here only PTR-MS results of the reaction 
of isoflurane with (H$_2$O)$_n$H$_3$O$^+$ and O$_2^+$ 
and of sevoflurane with (H$_2$O)$_n$H$_3$O$^+$ 
are provided, including the reagent ion signal intensities related to each experiment.
%
These are shown in figures \ref{fig:isof_h3o} - \ref{fig:sevo_h3o_h}.
%
%Note that the small differences (i.e. <3\%) in the relationship between the drift tube voltage and the \textit{E/N} are due to the hollow cathode and the reactor being set at slightly different pressures to optimise the reagent ion signal in each case. 
%
%
%The drift voltage range is different to those shown in other chapters because for the measurements presented in this chapter another PTR-MS instrument was used.
%
The structure of isoflurane and sevoflurane are shown in \autoref{fig:iso}.

%\subsubsection{Rate constants}
%%%The home-built \acrshort{sifdtms} instrument at the Heyrovsky Institute of Physical Chemistry of the Academy of Sciences in Prague (Czech Republic) has been described in detail elsewhere \cite{doi:10.1021/acs.analchem.5b02994}.

%The calculation of the rate constant comes from Su \cite{su1994parametrization}.

%The data for $\alpha$ and $\mu_D$ can be found in \cite{lide2012crc}.

%\section{Concerns at the moment}
%There are some concerns regarding isoflurane:
%\begin{itemize}
%    \item It is very sensitive to humidity. In the past, people thought that the discrepancies in the PTRMS results from isoflurane measurements were due to the difference geometries of the instruments from different manufacturers, which raised doubts about the standardisation of PTRMS.
%    \item There is an ion reported at  \textit{m/z} 163 by \cite{smith2003analysis}. The energy required for its fragmentation it is too high, around 1.8 eV.
%    \item Furthermore, the ion assigned to  \textit{m/z} 147 does not have proper isotopic distribution (note that the scale is logarithmic and  \textit{m/z} 149 is not 1/3 of \textit{m/z}  147)
%\end{itemize}
