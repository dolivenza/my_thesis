\markboth{Conclusions and Further Remarks}{}

The main goal of this thesis was to extend the underpinning knowledge of the ion-molecule processes taking place in \acrshort{scims} techniques, mainly PTR-MS, through both the experimental and theoretical analysis of ion-molecule reactions of molecules of interest with the reagent ions. % and their dependence on parameters like the reduced electric field. %different parameters
%
To accomplish this, several molecules of importance within the fields of homeland security and medicine have been studied to generate a database-like set of results including the product ions and their abundances at different values of the reduced electric field.
%
These substances of interest include  illicit drugs and related compounds (chapter \ref{chapter:cocaine} and appendix \ref{chapter:drugs}); 
TNT and related mono- and di- nitrotoluenes  (chapter \ref{chapter:RF});
nitroaniline isomers  (chapter \ref{chapter:nas});
linear, cyclic and branched ketones  (chapter \ref{chapter:KE}); 
phthalic acid and phthalate esters  (chapter \ref{chapter:PH}); 
and 
anaesthetics compounds  (appendix \ref{chapter:iso}).



The theoretical work in this thesis comprehends DFT calculations to obtain the energetics of the neutral molecules as well as of the proton transfer and fragmentation reactions these molecules undergo.
%
These were performed by Dr Peter Watts using the B3LYP functional with the 6-31+G(d,p) basis set in Gaussian09W and GaussView05 for Windows.

\subsection{Theoretical and experimental investigations of cocaine and related compounds
in PTR-MS}

A PTR-MS and theoretical (DFT) investigation of the reactions of cocaine and related compounds with (H$_2$O)$_n$H$_3$O$^+$ was exposed in this chapter.
%
A thermal desorption unit was used to inject the less volatile substances in the drift tube of the PTR-MS instrument while the investigation of benzoates and isobutyrates was done through headspace analysis.
%
The product ion signal intensities obtained from the reaction of the studied substances were given as a function of the reduced electric and the drift voltage for experiments in two different conditions of humidity (although for some compounds only the drier data was acquired).

The dominant reaction channel is non-dissociative proton transfer for cocaine, cocaethylene, methyl ecgonine, ethyl ecgonine, norcocaine, methyl ecgonidine, o-hydroxycocaine and methyl isobutyrate for the whole studied \textit{E/N} range.
%
In all the studied substances  (except the isobutyrate esters) the most common dissociative pathway is the loss of an alcohol (i.e. MeOH, EtOH or iPrOH in each case), which is supported by the DFT results, which unveiled that the loss of an alcohol is a barrierless process once the proton is attached to the 
ester oxygen.
%
A higher abundance of these dissociative product ions compared to the protonated parent was expected because the fragmentation pathway is exergonic and the proton is mobile between the main protonation sites.
%
However, the low fragmentation observed in PTR-MS  hints that the proton stays in the pyrolidine nitrogen, which is the most basic site, inhibiting any thermodynamically allowed dissociation.

%Cocaine metabolites and other related compounds were included in this study to complement and facilitate the PTR-MS study of cocaine.
%
%However, PTR-MS will almost definitely not be used as an analytical tool for the detection of these metabolites and therefore, contrary to  deployed instruments for field campaigns,  PTR-MS instrument was used here as a research tool, not an analytical tool.



Further work is needed to find the transition state for the loss of benzoic acid and to elucidate and clarify the challenges arising from  benzoylecgonine, ecgonine and ecgonidine in PTR-MS.

\subsection{Enhancement of Compound Selectivity Using a Radio Frequency Ion Funnel Proton Transfer Reaction Mass Spectrometer: Improved Specificity for Explosive Compounds}

Selectivity enhancements in the detection of TNT have been achieved through the implementation of a radio frequency ion funnel in the drift tube of a PTR-ToF-MS.
%
The ion funnel upgrade was originally conceived to funnel the ions in the second half of the reactor to enhance sensitivity.
%
However, it was found that it can also be used to induce fragmentation of the product ions and improve compound specificity through the extra collisional energy delivered by the RF field in the so-called RF mode.


The crucial aspect of this work is that it is a simple and cost-efficient alternative to other major and costly changes in instrumental design to improve the chemical specificity, such as having a high resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometer or adding a pre-separation technique.
%
Future research lines following this work include the rapid switching between RF and DC modes, which is hypothesised would be the best method to enhance selectivity.

\subsection{Selective Reagent Ion Mass Spectrometric Investigations of the Nitroanilines}

This research demonstrates the selectivity enhancement for the identification of three nitroaniline isomers through the use of SRI-MS techniques.
%
The product ion distributions arising from the reaction of the nitroaniline isomers with H$_3$O$^+$ and O$_2^+$ as a function of the reduced electric field are illustrated with quantum chemical  (DFT) calculations.

In the proton transfer mode, the protonated parent ion is the dominant ion for the three isomers for a broad reduced electric field range.
%
However, 3-nitroaniline solvates more than the 2- and 4- isomers at low \textit{E/N}, with the MH$^+$.H$_2$O ion reaching ca. 50\% of the PID at 60 Td.
%
This it is supported by the DFT calculations, which predicted that 3-nitroaniline binds water ca. 10 better than 2- and 4-nitroaniline, and allows to differentiate the 3- isomer from the 2- and 4-.
%
Moreover, the parent ion was also the dominant ion observed with the charge transfer mode for the three nitroanilines, but C$_6$H$_6$NO$^+$ becomes the dominant ion for 4-nitroaniline above approximately 190 Td, which allows the identification of the 4- isomer, as this never is higher than ca. 15\% for 2- or 3-nitroaniline.

\subsection{Compendium of the Reactions of H$_3$O$^+$ With Selected Ketones of Relevance
to Breath Analysis Using Proton Transfer Reaction Mass Spectrometry}

This study comprises a large database of the product ions and their relative intensities as a function of the \textit{E/N} for the reactions of H$_3$O$^+$ and H$_3$O$^+$.(H$_2$O) with a variety of ketones.
%
The observed product ion branching ratios can vary when using different instruments with different configurations and therefore they are only indicative of the reactions and fragmentation pathways taking place in the drift tube.
%
Furthermore, the manipulation of the collisional energy did not enhance the selectivity 
and hence a pre-separation stage, such as the fastGC add-on used in this investigation, is needed to separate isomeric compounds.

Future research lines following this study include the investigation of aldehydes in PTR-MS at different values of the reduced electric field.
%
There are two motivations for this: (i) aldehydes are isomers of ketones, and (ii) both ketones and aldehydes are present in breath samples.
%
However, previous PTR-MS studies have already demonstrated that aldehydes fragment considerably more than ketones, and therefore the contribution to the protonated parent ion signal coming from aldehydes will be a small part of that of the ketones at low and mid values of the \textit{E/N} \cite{buhr2002analysis,schwarz2009determining}.

\subsection{Investigation of Phthalate Esters in Proton Transfer Reaction Mass Spectrometry
via Direct Headspace Sampling}


These results demonstrate the feasibility of the detection of phthalic acid and ten phthalate esters in PTR-MS by means of headspace analysis. 
%
The product ion distributions arising from the reaction of the phthalates with H$_3$O$^+$ were provided for a function of the reduced electric range from 80 to 205 Td.
%
The identification of three isomers, namely  DBP, DiBP and MEHP, was proved possible without initial pre-separation by solely comparing the product ion distributions at different \textit{E/N} values.
%
Protonated phthalic anhydride (C$_8$H$_5$O$_3^+$, \textit{m/z} 149) is a common product ion observed in this PTR-MS investigation of phthalates, although it was not observed with dimethyl or diallyl phthalate.
%
For the alkyl diester phthalates the abundance of protonated phthalic anhydride  increases with the alkyl chain length and with the reduced electric field.
%
The loss of the corresponding alcohol (i.e. methanol for DMP, ethanol for DEP, propanol for DPP and butanol for DBP) from the protonated parent was also observed for all the studied alkyl diester phthalates.
%
In contrast to \textit{m/z} 149, the abundance of the loss of an alcohol decreases with the alkyl chain length.

%David – many thanks for your comments. Yes – I made a mistake in the summary – you are correct. 
%My interpretation of the data is that the BRs are humidity dependent but not the fragmentation pathways – the same ions are seen under dry and humid conditions. But we have already seen that we don’t understand the BRs even under a constant humidity so we cannot expect to understand the effects of changing the humidity – or for that matter changing E/N. 
%Changing the conditions of the hollow cathode – I have no idea – when I last spoke with Chris he suggested it might be worthwhile so you should ask him what he had in mind.
%A different topic. If we have these reactant ions with sufficient energy to fragment ISOF why do we propose more normal energy reactant ions when we study cocaine and the other compounds? My only suggestion is that the highly energetic ions cause massive fragmentation to small ions and are either lost in the noise or ignored or attributed to impurities. Can you have a look at some of the cocaine and analogues spectra and let me know? It’s a problem we have to address before we can publish parallel papers on cocaine and ISOF – and more importantly need to be addressed in your thesis.
%Best wishes - Peter
