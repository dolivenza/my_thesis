\section{Aim of the thesis}



%\texttt{The topic of my thesis is the underpinning of ion-molecule processes and their use as analytical probes in soft chemical ionisation mass spectrometry (SCIMS). This includes studying specific ion-molecule reaction processes and their dependence on temperature, reduced electric field, pressure, etc. This is being done in the field of homeland security, in particular to illicit drugs. I am also interested in studying the implementation of a radio frequency ion funnel in PTR-MS to enhance selectivity and sensitivity, and the use of a thermal desorption unit as method to detect semi volatile organic compounds. Moreover, I want to use computational methods to study the trajectories of ions inside the reactor of a PTR-MS instrument at different experimental conditions to gain knowledge about the transmission of ions to the subsequent stages of a PTR-MS instrument. Furthermore, I am one of the ten early stage researchers (ESRs) of the IMPACT network (see appendix).}
