% Experimental and theoretical study of cocaine and related compounds as well as other illicit drugs: heroin, morphine, ecstasy, etc.

% Experimental study of the nitroaniline isomers with different reagent ions.

% Experimental study of the reactions of several phthalate esters with H$_3$O$^+$.


% Study of the reactions of several ketones relevant to breath analysis with (H$_2$O)$_n$H$_3$O$^+$ (n = 0, 1) as a function of the reduced electric field.





% Two add-ons were used. A TDU for the less volatile VOCs. A fastGC was used in the study of ketones to assist in the ion identification.


% Studies as a function of the reduced electric field, \textit{E/N}.
